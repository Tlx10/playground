A Rapidus Corp. factory is under construction near New Chitose Airport in Chitose, Hokkaido, on Wednesday.

In a bid to strengthen supply chains and economic security in the wake of the global shortage of semiconductors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government is encouraging businesses and other organizations to expand domestic production of semiconductors. Plans to build factories for semiconductor-related industries have been mapped out across the country.

A wide range of businesses support the semiconductor industry, and local governments are expecting positive ripple effects from these initiatives.

Construction boom

A plot of land on the east side of New Chitose Airport, a gateway to Hokkaido, was recently crowded with cranes. A factory for Tokyo-based chipmaker Rapidus Corp. is being built there at a rapid pace.

Rapidus was established in 2022 and is funded by major Japanese companies. It also receives financial support from the central government.

In February last year, Rapidus announced it would build a plant in Chitose, Hokkaido, to mass produce next-generation chips with a circuit line width of 2 nanometers. The company plans to start the operation of a prototype production line at the plant in April next year, to prepare for full-scale operations to begin in 2027.

About 1,000 employees are expected to live in Chitose when operations start at the plant, so condominiums are being built in the center of the city. In fiscal 2023, about 40 construction permits for apartment buildings were issued in the city, more than double the number the previous year.

“We decided to enter the Hokkaido market after seeing the construction boom in Kumamoto Prefecture that took place after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. moved into the area,” said Masahiro Otsuka, president of Well Holdings Co., a real estate development company in Fukuoka City that is constructing a rental apartment building in Chitose.

Construction of the plant has also created cleaning, security and other jobs. The Chitose Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which serves as a contact point for relevant business and other activities, has received a number of inquiries related to Rapidus.

The number of special members of the chamber — business operators based outside the city — increased to 46 at the end of March 2024 from 26 at the end of March 2023.

Land prices are also soaring. According to official values as of March released by the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry, four of the 10 locations nationwide that saw the greatest rise in residential land prices were in Chitose.

Three of the 10 commercial plots that saw the highest increase in land prices also were in the city.

“Due partly to high materials costs, it’s becoming difficult for the general public to buy real estate in the city,” a property company president said. Chitose Mayor Ryuichi Yokota said in May the city wants to continuously supply residential land space as needed so there will no shortage of plots.

Newly established positions

Leading Taiwan semiconductor contract manufacturer Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (PSMC), in partnership with Tokyo-based major securities house SBI Holdings Inc., plans to start operations at a new plant in 2027 in Ohira, Miyagi Prefecture.

The village of Ohira is home to Toyota Motor East Japan Inc., and the surrounding area hosts many automobile-related companies. Since the automotive and semiconductor industries share common ground, local governments in surrounding areas are establishing new departments or positions to support the semiconductor industry to take advantage of the opportunity.

In December, the Miyagi prefectural government established a seven-person office to promote the semiconductor industry, and on May 2 Miyagi Gov. Yoshihiro Murai attended the opening ceremony of a new plant built by PSMC in Taiwan.

Murai appeared to have been impressed by the scale of the new plant, which will serve as a model for the Ohira plant. “We must provide significant support” to the semiconductor industry in the prefecture, he said.

The city of Sendai also created a new section chief post in charge of semiconductor-related industries as of June 1. The city will promote studies as well as sales and marketing activities to bring related businesses to the city, taking into account that a factory office will be opened in Sendai in as early as July.

“We want to maximize the economic benefits for the city,” said Tomoyuki Goto, a section chief of the city office.

Kenji Nakamura, director of the Kushiro Public University Research Center for Regional Economics at Kushiro Public University of Economics, said, “Local governments should focus on measures that will bring in related industries, such as the development of communications infrastructure for information technology companies, which are closely linked to the semiconductor sector.”

“The influx of talented people from Japan and overseas will make it also necessary to create a town that is comfortable for them to live in with their families. This is an excellent opportunity to improve the quality of education, leisure activities and others in the concerned areas,” Nakamura said.",2024-06-18T06:31:35.125380Z,d8366fc5faf3bd61295d317baddd0d72,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 21:00:00 GMT","Japan Seeks to Expand Domestic Semiconductor Production; Local Governments Anticipate Economic Benefits From ... - The Japan News

Murai appeared to have been impressed by the scale of the new plant, which will serve as a model for the Ohira plant. “We must provide significant support” to the semiconductor industry in the prefecture, he said.

The city of Sendai also created a new section chief post in charge of semiconductor-related industries as of June 1. The city will promote studies as well as sales and marketing activities to bring related businesses to the city, taking into account that a factory office will be opened in Sendai in as early as July.

“We want to maximize the economic benefits for the city,” said Tomoyuki Goto, a section chief of the city office.

Kenji Nakamura, director of the Kushiro Public University Research Center for Regional Economics at Kushiro Public University of Economics, said, “Local governments should focus on measures that will bring in related industries, such as the development of communications infrastructure for information technology companies, which are closely linked to the semiconductor sector.”

“The influx of talented people from Japan and overseas will make it also necessary to create a town that is comfortable for them to live in with their families. This is an excellent opportunity to improve the quality of education, leisure activities and others in the concerned areas,” Nakamura said.",semiconductor industry

Recently, as Taiwan's status in artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors is increasing, the number of Taiwanese students wishing to pursue science and engineering has increased significantly. This contrasts with South Korea, which is experiencing a ""black hole in medical schools.""

According to the China Times on the 17th, Taiwanese students have recently reported that the concentration of science and engineering in applying for college admission in 2024, which will enter the semester in September this year, is intensifying due to the craze for the AI and information and communication industries.

Taiwan's university admissions committee explained that the electrical departments of four national universities - Taiwan University in northern Taipei, Tsinghua University in Shinju, Yangming Transportation University and Tainan Success University in southern Taiwan - have almost filled their admissions.

Experts say that such a shift in support for science and engineering and information science is related to Taiwan's major share of the global semiconductor supply chain.

This is in contrast to the situation in Korea, where the science and engineering sector, which is a high-tech sector including semiconductors, is collapsing due to the extreme concentration of medical schools.

From this year's entrance examination, the government decided to increase the number of medical schools by about 1,500, which is expected to intensify the concentration of top-tier medical schools. It is explained that the contract department, which is guaranteed to hire large companies, will be more serious in giving up the registration of successful students.

Contract department refers to a department in which a university contracts with a company and opens a specific field required by the company as a major to cultivate manpower. After graduating from the department, employment at large companies is guaranteed unless there is a special reason for disqualification.

Currently, Samsung Electronics is selecting excellent talents by operating employment-linked contract departments at seven universities of ▲KAIST ▲ POSTECH ▲ GIST ▲ Daegu Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) ▲ Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) ▲ Yonsei University ▲ Sungkyunkwan University. In addition, SK Hynix has contracts with three universities: ▲ Korea University ▲ Seogang University ▲ Hanyang University.

However, the popularity of semiconductor departments is waning. As of 2024, the department of system semiconductor engineering at Yonsei University, Samsung Electronics' contract department, gave up enrollment, 23 out of 25 first-time applicants. This is a significant increase from 70% last year.

Samsung Electronics-linked Korea University's next-generation telecommunications department also increased 16.7% year-on-year as seven out of 10 people did not register. The entrance examination industry analyzes that most of the first successful applicants in semiconductor departments at the top major universities have fallen into medical school.

The industry is concerned that the status of K-semiconductor could be shaken if the top students turn away from semiconductor-related departments for a long time. If the talent shortage is not solved, it is expected that it will not survive in the semiconductor market, where competition is getting worse.

In fact, the market share gap between Taiwan's TSMC and Samsung Electronics in the foundry (semiconductor consignment production) sector in the first quarter of this year has widened.

According to Taiwanese market research firm TrendForce, TSMC's market share in the first quarter was 61.7%, up 0.5 percentage point from the previous quarter, while Samsung Electronics fell 0.3 percentage point to 11%.

Meanwhile, the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association predicted that the number of semiconductor manpower shortages in Korea will surge by about 30 times from 1,783 in 2022 to 56,000 in 2031.",2024-06-18T06:32:10.719233Z,6416919fa0a05163dbb0be680b1b6b26,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 07:29:28 GMT","Recently, as Taiwan's status in artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors is increasing, the numbe.. - MK - 매일경제

Recent insolvencies, such as that of Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor, have raised concerns about widespread closures. Additionally, the market has seen 23 semiconductor companies withdraw their IPO applications since last year, which reflects growing investor caution.

The trend of unfinished semiconductor projects initially started in 2020 and over 10,000 of Chinese chip-related companies had to close their doors in 2021 – 2022. A record-breaking 10,900 semiconductor-related companies deregistered in 2023, a significant increase from the 5,746 companies that closed down in 2022.

For example, Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor, a maker of OLED display drivers, microcontrollers, and CMOS image sensors, founded in 2021 with an investment of around $2.48 billion, recently went bankrupt due to financial difficulties. The bankruptcy of Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor is not an isolated issue and is tied to the earlier financial troubles of Wu Sheng Electronics Technology Group and Nanjing Wusheng Semiconductor Technology (later renamed Nanjingxin Charming Extreme Semiconductor Technology), reports Yibeiic.

In July 2020, a $3 billion IDM project was initiated in Nanjing, targeting a monthly output of 40,000 300-mm wafers and an annual value of over ¥6 billion ($827 million), but saw no progress. By the end of 2020, Nanjing Wusheng Semiconductor underwent a shareholder restructuring, rebranding as Xinyue Polar Core Semiconductor in 2021, and significantly reducing its registered capital. In April 2021, Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor announced an ¥18 billion yuan ($2.48 billion) investment plan to complete within five years. However, Wu Sheng Electronics filed for bankruptcy in 2023, and by now Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor has also become insolvent. This bankruptcy has sparked fears of a new wave of industry closures similar to those seen in 2020.

China's push to develop its semiconductor industry began in 2014, driven by substantial government subsidies. The result was a rapid increase in the number of semiconductor companies and parks. In 2020 alone, 50,000 semiconductor-related companies were registered, with substantial investments from provinces like Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Shanghai as well as from various government-controlled organizations.

However, several high-profile projects have come to nothing, including the collaboration between GlobalFoundries and Chengdu, which ended in failure, and the Wuhan Hongxin project, which was exposed as a scam. Since early 2023, 23 companies have retracted their plans to go public, highlighting the cautious stance of investors toward the sector.

Looking ahead, the tightening of IPO policies in 2024 is expected to make it harder for underqualified semiconductor companies to raise capital. Experts predict that higher listing standards will lead to more companies exiting the market due to financial challenges and increased difficulty in securing investment.

The global chip market is reported to have had a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14 percent over the last 20 years and is expected to become a multi-trillion dollar market by 2030.

Vietnam’s semiconductor industry has great potential to develop rapidly by working with the world’s leading corporations and the presence of large domestic tech firms.

Binh, who is also chair of Vinasa (Vietnam Software and IT Services Association), said at a workshop on May 29 that Vietnam has all favorable conditions, from nice weather, favorable terrain, to agreement among people to develop the industry.

Chips are a vital need of the world and this means a great opportunity for Vietnam. The chip manufacturing chain requires specific aptitudes specific to every nation, based on its past, culture and traditions.

Western people, for example, are good at argument and presentations. The theory about semiconductor originates from leading western universities. Meanwhile, 90 percent of software programmers and chip designers are Indian; and Vietnam is second in the world in terms of software exports.

Binh stressed that the world’s large chip supply sources are having problems. In South Korea, the third and fourth generations of chaebols, or large corporations, are facing internal crises. In Taiwan (China), geopolitical changes will have a big impact on the future of the island.

In such circumstances, Vietnam, with its strengths in culture and human resources, has emerged as a destination of the world’s semiconductor industry.

“History shows that Vietnam is a nation with a strong aspiration to rise and develop, and not yield to any power or difficulty. So, developing the semiconductor industry will definitely be possible in Vietnam,"" Binh said.

He said that that in AI, Vietnam needs to ‘run fast’ to create a position for Vietnam’s chips. If AI can be integrated into chips, the world’s chip manufacturers will want to cooperate with Vietnam.

Another opportunity for Vietnam is supplying human resources to chip manufacturing factories around the world.

Prompt action

“If Vietnam doesn’t take action immediately, it will miss the great opportunity of developing the semiconductor industry,” Binh said.

Nguyen Thi Le Quyen, deputy director of Hanoi Branch of the National Innovation Center (MIC) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), said semiconductors are an irreversible trend and the government has realized that this is a great opportunity which comes once in a thousand years.

A representative from MPI said that amid the hot global semiconductor race, leading chip manufacturing corporations in the world are joining the Vietnamese market.

In 2023 alone, Amkor and Hana Micro decided to build two factories in Vietnam capitalized at over $1 billion.

According to MPI, Vietnam now has a great opportunity but also faces challenges in training and human resources supply for the semiconductor industry.

Vietnam has sufficient conditions and capability to produce 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030, but there still exists a gap in quality between supply and demand.

The greatest challenges for Vietnam is the lack of experts and lecturers in the domestic educational sector. Semiconductor industry requires huge investment capital from the state, schools and businesses.

Vietnam is still lacking university training programs, and the existing programs cannot meet international standards compared with the semiconductor industry’s development.

Nguyen Thien Nghia from the Authority of ICT Industry said that Vietnam lacks both factory workers and engineers, which is a big challenge.

“The demand for diversifying supply chains has existed for only 1-2 years. And not only Vietnam, but other regional countries, including India, Malaysia, Pakistan and China, have been very quick in taking action.

“If Vietnam cannot take action immediately, the opportunity will be missed,” Nghia warned.

According to Nghia, the investment rate for less-than-16nm semiconductor technology is $10 billion, while 28nm needs $5-7 billion.

Meanwhile, the investment rate of $3-5 billion for 40-60nm technology is more acceptable. For 90nm technology, Vietnam will have to invest $500million-1 billion. These are factors for Vietnam to consider.

Asked about the market segments Vietnam should focus on, Nghia thinks that Vietnam has advantages in ICT infrastructure, including chips for telecommunications, data centers, and the energy sector.

The global chip market is reported to have had a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14 percent over the last 20 years and is expected to become a multi-trillion dollar market by 2030.

Vietnam’s semiconductor industry has great potential to develop rapidly by working with the world’s leading corporations and the presence of large domestic tech firms.

Binh, who is also chair of Vinasa (Vietnam Software and IT Services Association), said at a workshop on May 29 that Vietnam has all favorable conditions, from nice weather, favorable terrain, to agreement among people to develop the industry.

Chips are a vital need of the world and this means a great opportunity for Vietnam. The chip manufacturing chain requires specific aptitudes specific to every nation, based on its past, culture and traditions.

Western people, for example, are good at argument and presentations. The theory about semiconductor originates from leading western universities. Meanwhile, 90 percent of software programmers and chip designers are Indian; and Vietnam is second in the world in terms of software exports.

Binh stressed that the world’s large chip supply sources are having problems. In South Korea, the third and fourth generations of chaebols, or large corporations, are facing internal crises. In Taiwan (China), geopolitical changes will have a big impact on the future of the island.

In such circumstances, Vietnam, with its strengths in culture and human resources, has emerged as a destination of the world’s semiconductor industry.

“History shows that Vietnam is a nation with a strong aspiration to rise and develop, and not yield to any power or difficulty. So, developing the semiconductor industry will definitely be possible in Vietnam,"" Binh said.

He said that that in AI, Vietnam needs to ‘run fast’ to create a position for Vietnam’s chips. If AI can be integrated into chips, the world’s chip manufacturers will want to cooperate with Vietnam.

Another opportunity for Vietnam is supplying human resources to chip manufacturing factories around the world.

Prompt action

“If Vietnam doesn’t take action immediately, it will miss the great opportunity of developing the semiconductor industry,” Binh said.

Nguyen Thi Le Quyen, deputy director of Hanoi Branch of the National Innovation Center (MIC) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), said semiconductors are an irreversible trend and the government has realized that this is a great opportunity which comes once in a thousand years.

A representative from MPI said that amid the hot global semiconductor race, leading chip manufacturing corporations in the world are joining the Vietnamese market.

In 2023 alone, Amkor and Hana Micro decided to build two factories in Vietnam capitalized at over $1 billion.

According to MPI, Vietnam now has a great opportunity but also faces challenges in training and human resources supply for the semiconductor industry.

Vietnam has sufficient conditions and capability to produce 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030, but there still exists a gap in quality between supply and demand.

The greatest challenges for Vietnam is the lack of experts and lecturers in the domestic educational sector. Semiconductor industry requires huge investment capital from the state, schools and businesses.

But behind these powerful Nvidia chips spawning new software features, business automation, and accelerated computation, there's a suite of design software tools used by the engineers to make it all possible: electronic design automation (EDA).

Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) is the leader in EDA software, boasting a large portfolio of intellectual property and patents -- absolutely foundational stuff to the semiconductor industry and to AI development. Here's why the stock is, at the very least, worthy of your attention.

A bet on chip and AI research and development growth

Synopsys is a powerful platform business. Like a select few other EDA businesses (including Cadence Design Systems, the second-largest player), Synopsys combines various software tools and specialized hardware for engineers to design and verify chip and computing systems. Be it Nvidia, a data center customer, or one of the many other semiconductor and computing businesses, it's highly likely Synopsys' tools are being used in engineering teams' design work.

Given its broad suite of software and patent portfolio on critical parts and pieces to a modern computing system, Synopsys has become a type of bet on overall semiconductor and AI research and development (R&D) growth. Semiconductor and data center businesses tend to hold their R&D expense growth fairly stable, regardless of the normal sales cycle inherent with hardware. The reason? If a company lets its foot off the gas in R&D, it could fall behind its peers technologically, which can have a negative impact on future sales and profitability.

As a result, Synopsys has been reporting consistent revenue growth for years. So far in its current fiscal year, revenue is up nearly 19% from the year prior. Net income and free cash flow can be lumpy (owing to the timing of some of its customer projects), but by and large, this is a highly profitable software platform, too.

Synopsys as a secret AI stock

Many investors may have become aware of Synopsys in 2024 due to two events.

First, Nvidia announced (originally in 2023) that Synopsys and leading chip fab Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing would integrate Nvidia's AI-fueled cuLitho generative AI algorithm to help accelerate chip development and manufacturing. Score one for Nvidia.

And second, Synopsys announced a mega-acquisition back in January, of system design and physics simulation software giant Ansys. The deal is still pending regulatory review, but the proposed tie-up underscores how chip and AI designs are becoming increasingly pervasive in all parts of the economy. Be it data centers or more ""traditional economy"" systems like industrial equipment, manufacturing facilities, or cars, electronic designs are beginning to merge with mechanical ones. Synopsys acquiring Ansys would help it further its lead in EDA software as a result (and has set off a round of other acquisitions in the industry as well).

Is Synopsys stock a buy?

Given its steady and profitable growth, all deeply tied into the burgeoning AI industry, Synopsys could be a top investment in the years ahead. It does come with a steep price tag, though -- 64 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), or 45 times EPS based on Wall Street analysts' current year expectations.

This is near the high end of where the stock has traded over the long term, as more investors catch on to the key role Synopsys plays in the AI race. The high price tag may also reflect some optimism surrounding the potential Ansys takeover, should that occur early in 2025.

To help with the premium price, investors interested in Synopsys might consider using a dollar-cost average plan to build a position over time. Automating purchases, perhaps on a monthly basis, could lock in some buys when there's a dip in share price.

At any rate, given Synopsys' position in the AI revolution, this is a business worth keeping tabs on, as it is behind the scenes helping companies like Nvidia make rapid advances in computing technology.

But behind these powerful Nvidia chips that power new software features, business automation, and accelerated computation, lies a suite of design software tools used by engineers to make it all possible: electronic design automation (EDA).

Synopsis (NASDAQ: SNPS) is the leader in EDA software and has a large portfolio of intellectual property and patents – absolutely fundamental to the semiconductor industry and to the development of AI. Here’s why the stock is at least worth your attention.

A bet on the growth of chip and AI research and development

Synopsys is a powerful platform company. Like a select number of other EDA companies (including Cadence Design Systems, the second largest player), Synopsys combines several software tools and specialized hardware that enable engineers to design and verify chip and computer systems. Whether it is Nvidia, a data center customer, or one of the many other semiconductor and computer companies, it is highly likely that Synopsys tools are used in the design work of engineering teams.

Given the wide range of software and patent portfolios covering critical components of a modern computing system, Synopsys has become something of a bet on the overall growth of research and development (R&D) in semiconductors and AI. Semiconductor and data center companies tend to keep their R&D cost growth fairly stable, regardless of the normal sales cycle inherent in hardware. The reason? If a company takes its foot off the accelerator in R&D, it could fall behind its peers technologically, which could negatively impact future revenue and profitability.

As a result, Synopsys has reported consistent revenue growth for years. So far in the current fiscal year, sales are up nearly 19% from the year before. Net income and free cash flow may be lumpy (due to the timing of some customer projects), but overall this is also a very profitable software platform.

Synopsys as a Secret AI Stock

Many investors may have become aware of Synopsys in 2024 due to two events.

First, Nvidia announced (originally in 2023) that Synopsys is a leading chip manufacturer Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing would integrate Nvidia’s AI-powered cuLitho generative AI algorithm to help accelerate chip development and production. Score one for Nvidia.

And second, in January, Synopsys announced a mega-acquisition of a systems design and physics simulation software giant Ansys. The deal is still awaiting a review by regulators, but the proposed collaboration underlines how chip and AI designs are becoming increasingly widespread across all parts of the economy. Whether data centers or more ‘traditional economic’ systems such as industrial equipment, manufacturing facilities or automobiles, electronic designs are beginning to blend with mechanical designs. As a result, Synopsys’ acquisition of Ansys would help the company expand its lead in EDA software (and has also set off a round of other acquisitions in the sector).

The story continues

Is Synopsys stock a buy?

Given its steady and profitable growth, all of which is closely tied to the fast-growing AI industry, Synopsys could be a top investment in the coming years. However, it comes with a high price tag: 64 times earnings per share (EPS) over the last twelve months, or 45 times earnings per share based on Wall Street analysts’ expectations for this year.

This is near the high end of where the stock has traded over the long term, as more and more investors recognize the key role Synopsys is playing in the AI ​​race. The high price tag may also reflect some optimism surrounding the potential Ansys acquisition, should it take place in early 2025.

To help keep the premium price down, investors interested in Synopsys might consider using a dollar-cost averaging plan to build a position over time. Automating purchases, perhaps on a monthly basis, could freeze some purchases when the stock price falls.

In any case, given Synopsys’ position in the AI ​​revolution, this is a company worth keeping an eye on, as it helps companies like Nvidia make rapid advances in computing technology behind the scenes.

A Rapidus Corp. factory is under construction near New Chitose Airport in Chitose, Hokkaido, on Wednesday.

In a bid to strengthen supply chains and economic security in the wake of the global shortage of semiconductors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government is encouraging businesses and other organizations to expand domestic production of semiconductors. Plans to build factories for semiconductor-related industries have been mapped out across the country.

A wide range of businesses support the semiconductor industry, and local governments are expecting positive ripple effects from these initiatives.

Construction boom

A plot of land on the east side of New Chitose Airport, a gateway to Hokkaido, was recently crowded with cranes. A factory for Tokyo-based chipmaker Rapidus Corp. is being built there at a rapid pace.

Rapidus was established in 2022 and is funded by major Japanese companies. It also receives financial support from the central government.

In February last year, Rapidus announced it would build a plant in Chitose, Hokkaido, to mass produce next-generation chips with a circuit line width of 2 nanometers. The company plans to start the operation of a prototype production line at the plant in April next year, to prepare for full-scale operations to begin in 2027.

About 1,000 employees are expected to live in Chitose when operations start at the plant, so condominiums are being built in the center of the city. In fiscal 2023, about 40 construction permits for apartment buildings were issued in the city, more than double the number the previous year.

“We decided to enter the Hokkaido market after seeing the construction boom in Kumamoto Prefecture that took place after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. moved into the area,” said Masahiro Otsuka, president of Well Holdings Co., a real estate development company in Fukuoka City that is constructing a rental apartment building in Chitose.

Construction of the plant has also created cleaning, security and other jobs. The Chitose Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which serves as a contact point for relevant business and other activities, has received a number of inquiries related to Rapidus.

The number of special members of the chamber — business operators based outside the city — increased to 46 at the end of March 2024 from 26 at the end of March 2023.

Land prices are also soaring. According to official values as of March released by the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry, four of the 10 locations nationwide that saw the greatest rise in residential land prices were in Chitose.

Three of the 10 commercial plots that saw the highest increase in land prices also were in the city.

“Due partly to high materials costs, it’s becoming difficult for the general public to buy real estate in the city,” a property company president said. Chitose Mayor Ryuichi Yokota said in May the city wants to continuously supply residential land space as needed so there will no shortage of plots.

Newly established positions

Leading Taiwan semiconductor contract manufacturer Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (PSMC), in partnership with Tokyo-based major securities house SBI Holdings Inc., plans to start operations at a new plant in 2027 in Ohira, Miyagi Prefecture.

The village of Ohira is home to Toyota Motor East Japan Inc., and the surrounding area hosts many automobile-related companies. Since the automotive and semiconductor industries share common ground, local governments in surrounding areas are establishing new departments or positions to support the semiconductor industry to take advantage of the opportunity.

In December, the Miyagi prefectural government established a seven-person office to promote the semiconductor industry, and on May 2 Miyagi Gov. Yoshihiro Murai attended the opening ceremony of a new plant built by PSMC in Taiwan.

Murai appeared to have been impressed by the scale of the new plant, which will serve as a model for the Ohira plant. “We must provide significant support” to the semiconductor industry in the prefecture, he said.

The city of Sendai also created a new section chief post in charge of semiconductor-related industries as of June 1. The city will promote studies as well as sales and marketing activities to bring related businesses to the city, taking into account that a factory office will be opened in Sendai in as early as July.

“We want to maximize the economic benefits for the city,” said Tomoyuki Goto, a section chief of the city office.

Kenji Nakamura, director of the Kushiro Public University Research Center for Regional Economics at Kushiro Public University of Economics, said, “Local governments should focus on measures that will bring in related industries, such as the development of communications infrastructure for information technology companies, which are closely linked to the semiconductor sector.”

“The influx of talented people from Japan and overseas will make it also necessary to create a town that is comfortable for them to live in with their families. This is an excellent opportunity to improve the quality of education, leisure activities and others in the concerned areas,” Nakamura said.",2024-06-18T06:30:11.456279Z,d8366fc5faf3bd61295d317baddd0d72,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 21:00:00 GMT","Japan Seeks to Expand Domestic Semiconductor Production; Local Governments Anticipate Economic Benefits From ... - The Japan News

Recently, as Taiwan's status in artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors is increasing, the number of Taiwanese students wishing to pursue science and engineering has increased significantly. This contrasts with South Korea, which is experiencing a ""black hole in medical schools.""

According to the China Times on the 17th, Taiwanese students have recently reported that the concentration of science and engineering in applying for college admission in 2024, which will enter the semester in September this year, is intensifying due to the craze for the AI and information and communication industries.

Taiwan's university admissions committee explained that the electrical departments of four national universities - Taiwan University in northern Taipei, Tsinghua University in Shinju, Yangming Transportation University and Tainan Success University in southern Taiwan - have almost filled their admissions.

Experts say that such a shift in support for science and engineering and information science is related to Taiwan's major share of the global semiconductor supply chain.

This is in contrast to the situation in Korea, where the science and engineering sector, which is a high-tech sector including semiconductors, is collapsing due to the extreme concentration of medical schools.

From this year's entrance examination, the government decided to increase the number of medical schools by about 1,500, which is expected to intensify the concentration of top-tier medical schools. It is explained that the contract department, which is guaranteed to hire large companies, will be more serious in giving up the registration of successful students.

Contract department refers to a department in which a university contracts with a company and opens a specific field required by the company as a major to cultivate manpower. After graduating from the department, employment at large companies is guaranteed unless there is a special reason for disqualification.

Currently, Samsung Electronics is selecting excellent talents by operating employment-linked contract departments at seven universities of ▲KAIST ▲ POSTECH ▲ GIST ▲ Daegu Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) ▲ Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) ▲ Yonsei University ▲ Sungkyunkwan University. In addition, SK Hynix has contracts with three universities: ▲ Korea University ▲ Seogang University ▲ Hanyang University.

However, the popularity of semiconductor departments is waning. As of 2024, the department of system semiconductor engineering at Yonsei University, Samsung Electronics' contract department, gave up enrollment, 23 out of 25 first-time applicants. This is a significant increase from 70% last year.

Samsung Electronics-linked Korea University's next-generation telecommunications department also increased 16.7% year-on-year as seven out of 10 people did not register. The entrance examination industry analyzes that most of the first successful applicants in semiconductor departments at the top major universities have fallen into medical school.

The industry is concerned that the status of K-semiconductor could be shaken if the top students turn away from semiconductor-related departments for a long time. If the talent shortage is not solved, it is expected that it will not survive in the semiconductor market, where competition is getting worse.

In fact, the market share gap between Taiwan's TSMC and Samsung Electronics in the foundry (semiconductor consignment production) sector in the first quarter of this year has widened.

According to Taiwanese market research firm TrendForce, TSMC's market share in the first quarter was 61.7%, up 0.5 percentage point from the previous quarter, while Samsung Electronics fell 0.3 percentage point to 11%.

Meanwhile, the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association predicted that the number of semiconductor manpower shortages in Korea will surge by about 30 times from 1,783 in 2022 to 56,000 in 2031.",2024-06-18T06:30:49.072745Z,6416919fa0a05163dbb0be680b1b6b26,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 07:29:28 GMT","Recently, as Taiwan's status in artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors is increasing, the numbe.. - MK - 매일경제

The project would cover the entire R&D process for Infineon’s next-generation, automotive-grade Bluetooth chip that is to be carried out in Taiwan, the statement said.

This includes the involvement of international automotive electronic R&D experts, facilitating exchanges with local researchers and industry clients, and transferring expertise in the automotive domain, the German chipmaker said.

The goal is to complete the entire development process of next-generation Bluetooth chip design in Taiwan, from chip design and production to chip packaging and testing, it said.

“We are impressed by Taiwan’s dynamic innovation ecosystem, including its highly skilled R&D talent and strong industry clusters. Building on our strong foundation of existing partnerships with many Taiwanese companies, Infineon now significantly increases its R&D activities. We look forward to further enriching and broadening our collaborative efforts with our local partners,” Sam Geha, executive vice president of Internet of Things, compute and wireless business at Infineon, said in the statement.

Infineon is to team up with research institutes and technology-savvy schools, including the Industrial Technology Research Institute (工研院), National Taiwan University, National Cheng Kung University and National Taipei University of Technology, as well as multiple Taiwanese network module manufacturers and automotive system developers.

The collaboration is to focus on developing wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips and solutions for wireless battery management systems, next-generation smart cockpits, and smart car access systems.",2024-06-18T06:30:16.807207Z,185862adc8479a0feeac14afe838a9b5,"Mon, 17 Jun 2024 16:00:00 GMT","Infineon plans NT$1.2bn R&D center - 台北時報

Infineon is the latest among a slew of global semiconductor companies seeking to operate R&D centers in Taiwan given a resilient semiconductor ecosystem. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) makes advanced automotive chips for Infineon and NXP Semiconductors NV in Taiwan.

Under similar government initiatives, Nvidia Corp has set up its first artificial intelligence (AI) R&D center in Taiwan with total investment of NT$24.3 billion, including NT$6.7 billion in government subsidies, and is considering establishing a second one.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) is reportedly seeking government support to build a R&D center in Taiwan with total investment of NT$5 billion.

Infineon’s new investment is part of the “A+ Global Innovation Partnership Initiative Program,” an initiative launched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to accelerate Taiwan’s development of cutting-edge technologies by leveraging the strength of global industry leaders.

Infineon alone would inject about NT$720 million to establish the “Infineon advanced automotive and wireless communication semiconductor R&D center,” upgrading its existing Wireless Communication R&D Lab in Taiwan.

The R&D center investment, the first among European automotive chip manufacturers, would create NT$60 billion in production value for local automotive electronics, Infineon said in a statement yesterday.

The project would cover the entire R&D process for Infineon’s next-generation, automotive-grade Bluetooth chip that is to be carried out in Taiwan, the statement said.

This includes the involvement of international automotive electronic R&D experts, facilitating exchanges with local researchers and industry clients, and transferring expertise in the automotive domain, the German chipmaker said.

The goal is to complete the entire development process of next-generation Bluetooth chip design in Taiwan, from chip design and production to chip packaging and testing, it said.

“We are impressed by Taiwan’s dynamic innovation ecosystem, including its highly skilled R&D talent and strong industry clusters. Building on our strong foundation of existing partnerships with many Taiwanese companies, Infineon now significantly increases its R&D activities. We look forward to further enriching and broadening our collaborative efforts with our local partners,” Sam Geha, executive vice president of Internet of Things, compute and wireless business at Infineon, said in the statement.

Infineon is to team up with research institutes and technology-savvy schools, including the Industrial Technology Research Institute (工研院), National Taiwan University, National Cheng Kung University and National Taipei University of Technology, as well as multiple Taiwanese network module manufacturers and automotive system developers.

The collaboration is to focus on developing wireless communication technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips and solutions for wireless battery management systems, next-generation smart cockpits, and smart car access systems.",semiconductor industry

Recent insolvencies, such as that of Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor, have raised concerns about widespread closures. Additionally, the market has seen 23 semiconductor companies withdraw their IPO applications since last year, which reflects growing investor caution.

The trend of unfinished semiconductor projects initially started in 2020 and over 10,000 of Chinese chip-related companies had to close their doors in 2021 – 2022. A record-breaking 10,900 semiconductor-related companies deregistered in 2023, a significant increase from the 5,746 companies that closed down in 2022.

For example, Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor, a maker of OLED display drivers, microcontrollers, and CMOS image sensors, founded in 2021 with an investment of around $2.48 billion, recently went bankrupt due to financial difficulties. The bankruptcy of Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor is not an isolated issue and is tied to the earlier financial troubles of Wu Sheng Electronics Technology Group and Nanjing Wusheng Semiconductor Technology (later renamed Nanjingxin Charming Extreme Semiconductor Technology), reports Yibeiic.

In July 2020, a $3 billion IDM project was initiated in Nanjing, targeting a monthly output of 40,000 300-mm wafers and an annual value of over ¥6 billion ($827 million), but saw no progress. By the end of 2020, Nanjing Wusheng Semiconductor underwent a shareholder restructuring, rebranding as Xinyue Polar Core Semiconductor in 2021, and significantly reducing its registered capital. In April 2021, Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor announced an ¥18 billion yuan ($2.48 billion) investment plan to complete within five years. However, Wu Sheng Electronics filed for bankruptcy in 2023, and by now Shanghai Wusheng Semiconductor has also become insolvent. This bankruptcy has sparked fears of a new wave of industry closures similar to those seen in 2020.

China's push to develop its semiconductor industry began in 2014, driven by substantial government subsidies. The result was a rapid increase in the number of semiconductor companies and parks. In 2020 alone, 50,000 semiconductor-related companies were registered, with substantial investments from provinces like Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Shanghai as well as from various government-controlled organizations.

However, several high-profile projects have come to nothing, including the collaboration between GlobalFoundries and Chengdu, which ended in failure, and the Wuhan Hongxin project, which was exposed as a scam. Since early 2023, 23 companies have retracted their plans to go public, highlighting the cautious stance of investors toward the sector.

Looking ahead, the tightening of IPO policies in 2024 is expected to make it harder for underqualified semiconductor companies to raise capital. Experts predict that higher listing standards will lead to more companies exiting the market due to financial challenges and increased difficulty in securing investment.

The global chip market is reported to have had a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14 percent over the last 20 years and is expected to become a multi-trillion dollar market by 2030.

Vietnam’s semiconductor industry has great potential to develop rapidly by working with the world’s leading corporations and the presence of large domestic tech firms.

Binh, who is also chair of Vinasa (Vietnam Software and IT Services Association), said at a workshop on May 29 that Vietnam has all favorable conditions, from nice weather, favorable terrain, to agreement among people to develop the industry.

Chips are a vital need of the world and this means a great opportunity for Vietnam. The chip manufacturing chain requires specific aptitudes specific to every nation, based on its past, culture and traditions.

Western people, for example, are good at argument and presentations. The theory about semiconductor originates from leading western universities. Meanwhile, 90 percent of software programmers and chip designers are Indian; and Vietnam is second in the world in terms of software exports.

Binh stressed that the world’s large chip supply sources are having problems. In South Korea, the third and fourth generations of chaebols, or large corporations, are facing internal crises. In Taiwan (China), geopolitical changes will have a big impact on the future of the island.

In such circumstances, Vietnam, with its strengths in culture and human resources, has emerged as a destination of the world’s semiconductor industry.

“History shows that Vietnam is a nation with a strong aspiration to rise and develop, and not yield to any power or difficulty. So, developing the semiconductor industry will definitely be possible in Vietnam,"" Binh said.

He said that that in AI, Vietnam needs to ‘run fast’ to create a position for Vietnam’s chips. If AI can be integrated into chips, the world’s chip manufacturers will want to cooperate with Vietnam.

Another opportunity for Vietnam is supplying human resources to chip manufacturing factories around the world.

Prompt action

“If Vietnam doesn’t take action immediately, it will miss the great opportunity of developing the semiconductor industry,” Binh said.

Nguyen Thi Le Quyen, deputy director of Hanoi Branch of the National Innovation Center (MIC) under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), said semiconductors are an irreversible trend and the government has realized that this is a great opportunity which comes once in a thousand years.

A representative from MPI said that amid the hot global semiconductor race, leading chip manufacturing corporations in the world are joining the Vietnamese market.

In 2023 alone, Amkor and Hana Micro decided to build two factories in Vietnam capitalized at over $1 billion.

According to MPI, Vietnam now has a great opportunity but also faces challenges in training and human resources supply for the semiconductor industry.

Vietnam has sufficient conditions and capability to produce 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030, but there still exists a gap in quality between supply and demand.

The greatest challenges for Vietnam is the lack of experts and lecturers in the domestic educational sector. Semiconductor industry requires huge investment capital from the state, schools and businesses.

Vietnam is still lacking university training programs, and the existing programs cannot meet international standards compared with the semiconductor industry’s development.

Nguyen Thien Nghia from the Authority of ICT Industry said that Vietnam lacks both factory workers and engineers, which is a big challenge.

“The demand for diversifying supply chains has existed for only 1-2 years. And not only Vietnam, but other regional countries, including India, Malaysia, Pakistan and China, have been very quick in taking action.

“If Vietnam cannot take action immediately, the opportunity will be missed,” Nghia warned.

According to Nghia, the investment rate for less-than-16nm semiconductor technology is $10 billion, while 28nm needs $5-7 billion.

Meanwhile, the investment rate of $3-5 billion for 40-60nm technology is more acceptable. For 90nm technology, Vietnam will have to invest $500million-1 billion. These are factors for Vietnam to consider.

Asked about the market segments Vietnam should focus on, Nghia thinks that Vietnam has advantages in ICT infrastructure, including chips for telecommunications, data centers, and the energy sector.

But behind these powerful Nvidia chips spawning new software features, business automation, and accelerated computation, there's a suite of design software tools used by the engineers to make it all possible: electronic design automation (EDA).

Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) is the leader in EDA software, boasting a large portfolio of intellectual property and patents -- absolutely foundational stuff to the semiconductor industry and to AI development. Here's why the stock is, at the very least, worthy of your attention.

A bet on chip and AI research and development growth

Synopsys is a powerful platform business. Like a select few other EDA businesses (including Cadence Design Systems, the second-largest player), Synopsys combines various software tools and specialized hardware for engineers to design and verify chip and computing systems. Be it Nvidia, a data center customer, or one of the many other semiconductor and computing businesses, it's highly likely Synopsys' tools are being used in engineering teams' design work.

Given its broad suite of software and patent portfolio on critical parts and pieces to a modern computing system, Synopsys has become a type of bet on overall semiconductor and AI research and development (R&D) growth. Semiconductor and data center businesses tend to hold their R&D expense growth fairly stable, regardless of the normal sales cycle inherent with hardware. The reason? If a company lets its foot off the gas in R&D, it could fall behind its peers technologically, which can have a negative impact on future sales and profitability.

As a result, Synopsys has been reporting consistent revenue growth for years. So far in its current fiscal year, revenue is up nearly 19% from the year prior. Net income and free cash flow can be lumpy (owing to the timing of some of its customer projects), but by and large, this is a highly profitable software platform, too.

Synopsys as a secret AI stock

Many investors may have become aware of Synopsys in 2024 due to two events.

First, Nvidia announced (originally in 2023) that Synopsys and leading chip fab Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing would integrate Nvidia's AI-fueled cuLitho generative AI algorithm to help accelerate chip development and manufacturing. Score one for Nvidia.

And second, Synopsys announced a mega-acquisition back in January, of system design and physics simulation software giant Ansys. The deal is still pending regulatory review, but the proposed tie-up underscores how chip and AI designs are becoming increasingly pervasive in all parts of the economy. Be it data centers or more ""traditional economy"" systems like industrial equipment, manufacturing facilities, or cars, electronic designs are beginning to merge with mechanical ones. Synopsys acquiring Ansys would help it further its lead in EDA software as a result (and has set off a round of other acquisitions in the industry as well).

Is Synopsys stock a buy?

Given its steady and profitable growth, all deeply tied into the burgeoning AI industry, Synopsys could be a top investment in the years ahead. It does come with a steep price tag, though -- 64 times trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS), or 45 times EPS based on Wall Street analysts' current year expectations.

This is near the high end of where the stock has traded over the long term, as more investors catch on to the key role Synopsys plays in the AI race. The high price tag may also reflect some optimism surrounding the potential Ansys takeover, should that occur early in 2025.

To help with the premium price, investors interested in Synopsys might consider using a dollar-cost average plan to build a position over time. Automating purchases, perhaps on a monthly basis, could lock in some buys when there's a dip in share price.

At any rate, given Synopsys' position in the AI revolution, this is a business worth keeping tabs on, as it is behind the scenes helping companies like Nvidia make rapid advances in computing technology.

But behind these powerful Nvidia chips that power new software features, business automation, and accelerated computation, lies a suite of design software tools used by engineers to make it all possible: electronic design automation (EDA).

Synopsis (NASDAQ: SNPS) is the leader in EDA software and has a large portfolio of intellectual property and patents – absolutely fundamental to the semiconductor industry and to the development of AI. Here’s why the stock is at least worth your attention.

A bet on the growth of chip and AI research and development

Synopsys is a powerful platform company. Like a select number of other EDA companies (including Cadence Design Systems, the second largest player), Synopsys combines several software tools and specialized hardware that enable engineers to design and verify chip and computer systems. Whether it is Nvidia, a data center customer, or one of the many other semiconductor and computer companies, it is highly likely that Synopsys tools are used in the design work of engineering teams.

Given the wide range of software and patent portfolios covering critical components of a modern computing system, Synopsys has become something of a bet on the overall growth of research and development (R&D) in semiconductors and AI. Semiconductor and data center companies tend to keep their R&D cost growth fairly stable, regardless of the normal sales cycle inherent in hardware. The reason? If a company takes its foot off the accelerator in R&D, it could fall behind its peers technologically, which could negatively impact future revenue and profitability.

As a result, Synopsys has reported consistent revenue growth for years. So far in the current fiscal year, sales are up nearly 19% from the year before. Net income and free cash flow may be lumpy (due to the timing of some customer projects), but overall this is also a very profitable software platform.

Synopsys as a Secret AI Stock

Many investors may have become aware of Synopsys in 2024 due to two events.

First, Nvidia announced (originally in 2023) that Synopsys is a leading chip manufacturer Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing would integrate Nvidia’s AI-powered cuLitho generative AI algorithm to help accelerate chip development and production. Score one for Nvidia.

And second, in January, Synopsys announced a mega-acquisition of a systems design and physics simulation software giant Ansys. The deal is still awaiting a review by regulators, but the proposed collaboration underlines how chip and AI designs are becoming increasingly widespread across all parts of the economy. Whether data centers or more ‘traditional economic’ systems such as industrial equipment, manufacturing facilities or automobiles, electronic designs are beginning to blend with mechanical designs. As a result, Synopsys’ acquisition of Ansys would help the company expand its lead in EDA software (and has also set off a round of other acquisitions in the sector).

The story continues

Is Synopsys stock a buy?

Given its steady and profitable growth, all of which is closely tied to the fast-growing AI industry, Synopsys could be a top investment in the coming years. However, it comes with a high price tag: 64 times earnings per share (EPS) over the last twelve months, or 45 times earnings per share based on Wall Street analysts’ expectations for this year.

This is near the high end of where the stock has traded over the long term, as more and more investors recognize the key role Synopsys is playing in the AI ​​race. The high price tag may also reflect some optimism surrounding the potential Ansys acquisition, should it take place in early 2025.

To help keep the premium price down, investors interested in Synopsys might consider using a dollar-cost averaging plan to build a position over time. Automating purchases, perhaps on a monthly basis, could freeze some purchases when the stock price falls.

In any case, given Synopsys’ position in the AI ​​revolution, this is a company worth keeping an eye on, as it helps companies like Nvidia make rapid advances in computing technology behind the scenes.
